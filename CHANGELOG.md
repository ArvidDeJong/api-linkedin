All notable changes to `darvis/api-linkedin` are documented here.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-13

The connection now knows what it may actually do. Until this release the package
decided that from the **config**, while LinkedIn decides it from the **granted
scopes** — and the two drift apart the moment a LinkedIn app misses a product. That
gap made an app without the Community Management API impossible to connect at all,
and made every company page it did offer publish into an unexplained 403.

### Added

- `Scopes` — the scopes the package works with, grouped by the LinkedIn product that grants them. `Scopes::MEMBER` is the set every app can hold.
- Scope knowledge on `LinkedInAccount`: `grantedScopes()`, `knowsScopes()`, `hasScope()`, `lacksScope()`, `canPostAsOrganization()`, `canListOrganizations()`. `hasScope()` and `lacksScope()` are deliberately **not** each other's negation — both are `false` when the scopes are unknown, so the package never guesses.
- `LinkedIn::canListOrganizations()` and `LinkedIn::canPostAsOrganization()` — gate your UI on these instead of on the config, or you offer targets that cannot be published to.
- `LinkedInOAuth::authorizationUrl($state, $scopes)` and `connectFromCode($code, $requestedScopes)` take the scopes explicitly. Without this the only way to narrow a request was to mutate the config mid-request.
- `?profile_only=1` on the built-in connect route asks for `Scopes::MEMBER` only, so an app without the Community Management API can still connect — on the member's profile. LinkedIn refuses the *entire* authorization over one unauthorized scope, so asking for less is the only way through.
- `AuthorizationDenial::fromCallback($request)` reads a refused authorization: `description` (HTML-decoded — LinkedIn escapes it, and echoing it straight into Blade showed the entities), `isScopeProblem()`, `missingScope()` and `isRecoverableWithMemberScopes()`.
- `LinkedInScopeMissing` — thrown *before* the request goes out when the stored scopes prove the call would come back as a 403. Carries the `scope` and names the missing LinkedIn product.
- `linkedin.session.scopes_key` — where the built-in flow remembers the scopes it asked for.

### Changed

- `organizations()` and publishing as a company page now refuse up front when the token provably lacks the scope, instead of firing a request that returns a 403 that is indistinguishable from an expired token or a page you do not administer.
- `connectFromCode()` no longer records the *configured* scopes when LinkedIn omits `scope` from the token response. It records the scopes actually requested for that flow; the config may have changed since the redirect, and a wrong guess is worse than none — every capability check leans on this column.

### Upgrading

Nothing breaks. A connection stored before 1.4 has no recorded scopes: `grantedScopes()` returns `null`, both `hasScope()` and `lacksScope()` return `false`, and no guard fires — such an account keeps working exactly as before. Reconnect it to unlock the capability checks.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Typed exceptions, so callers can react on the **type** instead of parsing the message (which is free to change between releases). All of them extend `LinkedInException`, so existing `catch (LinkedInException $e)` keeps working:
  - `LinkedInNotConnected` — no account is connected.
  - `LinkedInConnectionExpired` — the token expired and cannot be refreshed; the user must reconnect. The one failure an end user can act on.
  - `LinkedInConfigurationException` — a required setting is missing (e.g. posting to a company page without an URN).
  - `LinkedInApiException` — LinkedIn answered with an error. Carries `operation` (`token`, `profile`, `publish`, `organizations`), `status`, `body` and `isAuthorizationProblem()` (401/403).

Applications that show messages in another language can now map these types onto their own copy, instead of displaying the package's English text.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- `LinkedIn::organizations()` lists the company pages the connected member administers (name, URN, vanity name), through the `organizationAcls` endpoint. The list is cached (`linkedin.organizations.cache_ttl`, one hour by default); `organizations(fresh: true)` and `forgetOrganizations()` bypass or clear it.
- `linkedin.organizations.enabled` — off by default. Turning it on adds the `r_organization_admin` scope (and `w_organization_social`) to the authorization request. **Requires reconnecting**: tokens issued earlier do not carry the scope.
- New service `LinkedInOrganizations`, registered as a singleton.

### Changed

- `postAsOrganization()` takes an optional second argument: the URN of the page to post on. Without it the default from `linkedin.organization_urn` is used, so existing calls keep working.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **The code is now fully English**: comments, docblocks, exception messages and test descriptions.
- **The flash messages of the built-in OAuth routes are now English** (e.g. `LinkedIn connected as ...` instead of `LinkedIn gekoppeld als ...`). This is visible to end users. Applications that want Dutch messages can read `session('linkedin_status')` / `session('linkedin_error')` and translate them themselves.

### Added

- Bilingual documentation: English in the root, Dutch under [`docs/nl/`](docs/nl/README.md).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- OAuth 2.0 (authorization code) flow with LinkedIn, without an external dependency (`LinkedInOAuth`).
- Publishing posts through the Posts API on behalf of a member or a company page (`LinkedInPublisher`).
- `LinkedInAccount` model with encrypted tokens and automatic token refresh.
- `LinkedIn` facade and `LinkedInManager` for `postAsMember()` / `postAsOrganization()`.
- Optional, configurable connect/callback routes and controller.
- Publishable config and migration.
